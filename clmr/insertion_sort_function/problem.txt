Pseudocode for Insertion-Sort(A)

for j = 2 to A.length
    key = A[j]
    // Insert A[j] into the sorted sequence A[1..j-1]
    while i > 0 and A[i] > key
        A[i+1] = A[i]
        i = i-1
    A[i+1] = key

My plan is to make an array of pointers the size of the input array,
then sort the array of pointers with the above algorithm
