PROBLEM

a.  Write a program to process a collection of daily high temperatures. Your
    program should count and print the number of hot days (high temperature
    85 or higher), the number of pleasant days (high temperature 60-84), and
    the number of cold days (high temperatures less than 60). It should also
    display the category of each temperature. Test your program on the fol-
    lowing data:

    55  62  68  74  59  45  41  58  60  67  65  78  82  88  91
    92  90  93  87  78  79  72  68  61  59

b.  Modify your program to display the average temperature (a real number)
    at the end of the run.
