Modify your program to compute and display both the range of values in the
data collection and the standard deviation of the data collection. To compute
the standard deviation, accumulate the sum of the squares of the data values
(sum_squares) in the main loop. After loop exit, use the formula

        standard deviation = âˆš(sum_squares/N - average **2)
