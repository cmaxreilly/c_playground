The greatest common divisor (gcd) of two integers is the product of the inte-
gers' common factors. Write a program that inputs two numbers and imple-
ments the following approach to finding their gcd. We will use the numbers
-252 and 735. Working with the numbers' absolute values, we find the 
remainer of one divided by the other.
