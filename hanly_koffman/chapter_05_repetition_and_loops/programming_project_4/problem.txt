PROBLEM

Let n be a positive integer consisting of up to 10 digits, d10, d9, ..., d1.
Write a program to list in one column each of the digits in the number n. The
rightmost digit, d1, should e listed at the top of the column. Hint: If n is
3704, what is the value of the digit when computed by using 

digit = n % 10;

Test your program for values of n equal to 6, 3704, and 170,498.
