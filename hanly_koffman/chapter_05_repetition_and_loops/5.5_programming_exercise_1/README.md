Write a loop that displays a table of angle measures along with their sine and
cosine values. Assume that the initial and final angle measures (in degrees)
are available in init_degree and final_degree (type int variables),
and that the change in angle measure between table entries is given by 
step_degree (also a type int variable). Remember that the math
library's sin and cos functions take arguments that are in radians.

Relevant formulas: Degrees * (Ï€/180) = Radians
