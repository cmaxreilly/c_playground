PROBLEM

Write a program to process weekly employee time cards for all employees of
an organization. Each employee will have three data items: an identification
number, the hourly wage rate, and the number of hours worked during a 
given week. Each employee is to be paid time and a half for all hours worked
over 40. A tax amount of 3.625 percent of gross salary will be deducted. The
program output should show the employee's number and net pay. Display the
total payroll and the average amount paid at the end of the run.

Algorithm

print( Welcome! this program processes time cards for employees of C. Maxwell Reilly music studio. )
print( In order to start entering an employee time card, press "t" on your keyboard. )
print( Once you have entered all of your data, press x )

While (input != x)
	print (Enter the option you would like at the prompt >> )
	if input == x :
		input = x
	else if input == t:
		print("enter employee id number")
		scan id number
		print("enter hourly wage")
		scan hourly wage
		print("enter number of hours")
		scan number of hours
		print (Enter the option you would like at the prompt >> )
		if input == x

	This is a difficult problem! I am not quite sure how event loops work in C. I am going to try to 
	finish a working algorithm for this particular project, but I may have to revise it heavily in 
	order for it to work at all. Perhaps I need to start by making a simply event loop and seeing if
	I can get that to work...

	Update: I have gotten a small event loop to work. I now have to start in on getting ready for 35MM
	at the college, so I will probably be done for the day...

	Last update: Just finished the program! I have tried every run of it and edited the print formatting,
	and it seems that the program is running perfectly as expected! I am very much enjoying my linux machine,
	so I think I will keep doing this type of work on it as time goes forward.
