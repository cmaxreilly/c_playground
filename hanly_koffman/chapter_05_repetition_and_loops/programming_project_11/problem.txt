PROBLEM

Before high-resolution graphics displays became common, computer ter-
minals were often used to display graphs of equations using only text char-
achters. A typical technique was to creat a vertical graph by spacing over on
the screen, then displaying an *. Write a program that displays the graph of
an increasing frequency sine wave this way. The program should ask the 
usier for an initial step-size in degrees and the number of lines of the graph
to display. A saimple output begins as follows: (insert sine wave here, lol.)
