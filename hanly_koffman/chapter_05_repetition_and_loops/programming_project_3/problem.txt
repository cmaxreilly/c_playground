the environmental Awareness Club of BigCorp International is proposing
that the company subsidize at $.08 per passenger km the commuting costs of
employees who form carpools that meet a prescribed minimum passenger
efficiency. Passenger efficiency P (in passenger-kilometers per liter) is
defined as

        P = ns / l

where n is the number of passengers, s is the distance traveled in km, and l is
the number of liters of gasoline used.

Write a program that prompts the user for a minimum passenger effi-
ciency and then processes a file of data on existing carpools
(carpool.dat), displaying a table of all carpools that meet the passenger
efficiency minimum. the file represents each carpool as a data line contain-
ing three numbers: the number of people in the carpool, the total commuting
distance per five-day week, and the number of liters of gasoline consumed in
a week of commuting. The data file ends with a line of zeros. Display your
results wth this format: (pg 271)
