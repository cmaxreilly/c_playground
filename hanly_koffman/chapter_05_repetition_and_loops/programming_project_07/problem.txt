PROBLEM

Suppose you own a beer distributuorhip that sells Piels (ID number 1), Coors
(ID number 2), Bud (ID number 3), and Iron City (ID number 4) by the case.
Write a program to:

a. Get the case inventory for each brand for the start of the week.
b. Process all weekly sales and purchase records for each bran.
c. Display out the final inventory.

Each transaction will consist of two data items. The first item will be the brand 
ID number (an integer). The second will be the amount purchased (a positive 
integer value) or the amount sold (a negative integer value). For now you may
assume that you always have sufficient foresight to prevent depletion of your
inventory for any brand. (Hint: your data entry should begin with four values
representing case inventory, followed by the transaction values.)
