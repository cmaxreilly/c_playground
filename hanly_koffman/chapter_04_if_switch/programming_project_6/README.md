Write a program that determines the day number (1 to 366) in a year for
a date that is provides as input data. As an example, January 1, 1994, is
day 1. December 31, 1993, is day 365. December 31 1996, is day 366,
since 1996 is a leap yar. A year is a leap year only if it is divisible by four,
except that ny year divisible by 100 is a leap year only if it is divisible
by 400. Your program should accept the month, day, and year as integers.
Include a fuction leap() that returns 1 if called with a leap year, 0
otherwise.
