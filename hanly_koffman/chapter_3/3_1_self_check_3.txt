In order for exercise 1 to work for overtime, I would 
have to add an input of type double for overtime hours
worked. Then, in the algorithm area of the program, I 
would have to set gross salary equal to normal hours 
worked times hourly rate, plus overtime hours worked 
times hourly rate time 1.5.
