# Programming Project 3, Chapter 7
## Problem
The rate of decay of a radioactive isotope is given in terms of its half-life *H*,
the time lapse required for the isotope to decay to one-half of its original
mass. The isotope strontium-90 (90Sr) has a half-life of 28 years. Compute
and print in table form the amount of this isotope that remains after each year
for *n* years, given the initial presence of an amount in grams. The values of *n*
and *amount* should be provided interactively. The amount of 90Sr remaining
can be computed by using the following formula:

$$r=amount * C^{(y/H)}$$

where *amount* is the initial amount in grams, *C* is expressed as $e^{-0.693}$ (*e* =
2.71828), *y* is the number of years elapsed, and *H* is the half life of the iso-
tope in years
