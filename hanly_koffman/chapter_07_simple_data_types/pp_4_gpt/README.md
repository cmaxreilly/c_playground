# Programming Project 4, chapter 7
This programming project is about finding the value of PI.
## Description
The value of $\pi$ can be determined by the series equation
$$
\pi = 4 x (1 - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{9} - \frac{1}{11} + \frac{1}{13} -
...)
$$

Write a program to approximate the value of $\pi$ using the formula given
including terms up through 1/99.
