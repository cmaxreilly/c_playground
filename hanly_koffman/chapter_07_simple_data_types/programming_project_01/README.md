## Programming Project 1
Write a program that computes the sum

$$s = \sum_{ i = 1 }^{1000} x $$
where x = 0.1

Compute the sum twice: Once with variables for s and x declared float,
once with variables declared double. Calculate the error in each sum
1000.0 - s. You may wish to use these declarations:

float sf, xf = 0.1f:
double sd, xd = 0.1;
