The square root of a number N can be approximated by repeated calculation
using the formula

            NG = 0.5(LG + N/LG)

where NG stands for next guess and LG stands for last guess. Write a func-
tion that calculates the square root of a number using this method.
    The initial guess will be the starting value of LG. The program will
compute a value for NG using the formula given. The difference between
NG and LG is checked to see whether these two guesses are almost identi-
cal. If they are, NG is accepted as the square root; otherwise, the new
guess (NG) becomes the last guess (LG) and the process is repeated (anoth-
er value is computed for NG, the difference is checked, and so on). The
loop should be repetaed until the difference is less than 0.005. Use an ini-
tial guess of 1.0
    Write a driver function and test your squre root function for the numbers
4, 120.5, 88, 36.01, 10000, and 0.25.
