Determine the following information about each value in a list of positive
integers.

a. Is the value a multiple of 7, 11, or 13?
b. Is the sum of the digits odd or even?
c. Is the value a prime number?

You should write a function with three type int output parameters that send back
the answers to these three questions. Some sample input data might be:

104   3773   13   121   77   30751

This one is fairly complicated, so I believe that the function they have asked
for will actually just be a driver function for several other functions.

Pseudocode:

main
{
    numbers = [ all the numbers I want to check ]
    int multiple_7, multiple_11, multiple_13, sum_is_odd_or_even, is_prime_number

}

driver_function(number *is_multiplep *sum_is_odd_or_evenp *is_prime_numberp)
{
    *is_mutiplep = is_multiplef(number, &multiple_7, &multiple_11, &multiple_13)
    *sum_is_odd_or_evenp = sum_is_odd_or_evenf(number)
    *is_prime_numberp = is_prime_numberf(number)
}

report(number, multiple_7, multiple_11, multiple_13, sum_is_odd_or_even, is_prime_number)
{
    printf("%d", number)
    if multiple_7 = 1
        printf(" is a multiple of 7, ")
    else
        printf(" is not a multiple of 7, ")
    if multiple_11 = 1
        printf(" is a multiple of 11, ")
    else
        printf(" is not a multiple of 11, ")
    if multiple_13 = 1
        printf(" is a multiple of 13, ")
    else
        printf(" is not a multiple of 13, ")
    if sum_is_odd_or_even = 1
        printf(" has digits that sum to an even number,")
    else
        printf(" has digits that sum to an odd number,")
    if is_prime_number = 1
        printf(" and is a prime number. \n");
    else
        printf(" and is not a prime number. \n");
}
