Write a program for an automatic teller machine that dispenses money. The
user should enter the amount desired (a multiple of 10 dollars) and
the machine dispenses this amount using the least number of bills. The bills
dispensed are 50s, 20s, and 10s. Write a function that determines how many
of each kind of bill to dispense.
