Develp a collection of functions to solve simple conduction problems using
various forms of the formula


        H = kA(T2 - T1)
            -----------
                 X
where H is the rate of heat transfer in watts, k is the coefficient of thermal
conductivity for the particular substance, A is the cross-sectional area in m^2
(square meters), T2 and T1 are the kelvin temperatures on the two sides of the
conductor, and X is the thickness of the conductor in meters.

Define a function for each variable in the formula. For example, a function
calc_h would compute the rate of heat transfer, calc_k would figure the
coefficient of thermal conductivity, calc_a would find the cross-sectional
area, and so on. Develop a driver function that interacts with the user in the following way:

Respond to the prompts with the data known. For the
unknown quantity, enter a questoin mark (?).

Rate of heat transfer (watts) >> 755.0
Coefficient of thermal conductivity (W/m-K) >> 0.8
Cross-sectional area of conductor (m^2) >> 0.12
Temperature on one side (K) >> ?
Thickness of conductor (m) >> 0.003

          kA (T2 - T1)
    H = ----------------
                X

Temperature on the other side is 274 K.

H = 755.0 W                 T2 = 298 K
k = 0.800 W/m-K             T1 = 274 K
A = 0.120 m^2               X  = 0.0003 m

(Hint: Input of the question mark when looking for a number will cause
 scanf to return a value of 0. Be sure to check for this, and then scan the
 question mark into a character variable before proceeding with the remaining
 prompts.)
