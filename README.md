# C Playground

Greetings. This is my repository for my study of C. In it, I do many of the exercises from two
popular volumes on C programming and program design.

The two volumes I am working from are:

- Kernigan and Ritchies book The C Programming Language
- Problem Solving and Program Design in C by Jeri R. Hanly and Elliot B. Koffman. 

## Goals
- Write a bit of C five days a week
- Build a small calculator that parses inifix mathematical expressions in the commandline.
- Work through all of the exercises in the Hanly Koffman book by the end of the summer.
