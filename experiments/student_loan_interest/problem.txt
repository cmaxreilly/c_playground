PROBLEM

My mother took out student loans for medical school. Her initial balance was $85,000, and she has paid
$650 a month. Her initial APR was 7.2%, and she recently had $55,000 forgiven. How much money did she pay?
How much was interest? Take into account leap years and the different lengths of each month.
