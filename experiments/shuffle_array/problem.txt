Problem

I would like to create a utility that shuffles pitches randomly and prints all
of the possibilities in C. The first thing I need to do is figure out how to
shuffle an array of letters in C. I would like to shuffle an array of pointers
so that the original array stays intact. This will involve use of pointers and
use of the random syscall, which will be the first time I have used a syscall in
C.

Note: This is much more complicated of a problem than I thought. I will spend
the rest of my time just studying C. and practicing the syntax. Once I am better
at that, I will start sitting down and working on algorithms in C.
