My objective is to figure out how many cartridges of 30.06 I need to reload in
order to make purchase profitable. This program will be a quick and dirty c
program that figures out my profit margin based upon the number of rifle
cartridges I reload, compared to if I had purchased a simlar load at retail
price.

Data I need:
• Standard price of cartridges ( 1.5 dollars per bullet)
• Price of bullets/quantity (Speer 165 grain bullets)
• Price of powder/quantity (Accurate 2700 powder)
• Price of primers:
• Price of powder (Hodgdon accurate 4350)
• Price of reloading equipment kit:
    • Press (RCBS Special 5)
    • Dies
    • case primer device/tool
    • Case trimer
        • 30 caliber cullet
    • Powder Trickler
    • Scale (digital in grains)
    • Case Lube (Hornady One Shot)
    • Bullet puller √
    • Caliper
    • Case prep kit
        • Primer pocket cleaner
        • De-burring tool
    • Reloading Manual (Speer or Hornady)

Notes
• Speer and RCBS are the same company.
• 30.06 Die Reference Data
    • Die Group: A
    • RCBS
• Rifle Bounce: Jeff cooper
• RCBS, Hornady, Limane
• Do not buy Lee anything

So, it seems that the best way to do this would be to make my own brass by
shooting a bunch cartridges. Dad recommends getting like 4 boxes of the same
cartridges from the same lot, and then reloading the brass. Keep track of all of
the number of times you have reloaded.
