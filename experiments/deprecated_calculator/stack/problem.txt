PROBLEM

the environmental Awareness Club of BigCorp International is proposing
that the company subsidize at $.08 per passenger km the commuting costs of
employees who form carpools that meet a prescribed minimum passenger
efficiency. Passenger efficiency P (in passenger-kilometers per liter) is
defined as

        P = ns / l

where n is the number of passengers, s is the distance traveled in km, and l is
the number of liters of gasoline used.

Write a program that prompts the user for a minimum passenger effi-
ciency and then processes a file of data on existing carpools
(carpool.dat), displaying a table of all carpools that meet the passenger
efficiency minimum. the file represents each carpool as a data line contain-
ing three numbers: the number of people in the carpool, the total commuting
distance per five-day week, and the number of liters of gasoline consumed in
a week of commuting. The data file ends with a line of zeros. Display your
results wth this format: (pg 271)


ALGORITHM

(draft 3)

1. Get minimum passenger efficientcy from user

    a. prompt user
    b. scan efficiency to variable
    c. check if variable is correct type
    if (variable is correct type)
        return
    else
        prompt user for correction

2. Print Header

3. Process line fom file
    scan line from file
    while (line not "0 0 0") {
        calc passage efficiency
        if (passenger efficiency > minimum passenger efficiency)
            scan next line
        else
            print data
            scan next line
            calc passenger efficiency
    }

DATA

Global variables:
    input variables
        double minimum passenger efficiency

    output variables
        double passenger efficiency
        int numbr of passengers
        double distance traveled in km
        double liters of gasoline used




FUNCTIONS

1. Scan line from file
2. Calculate passenger efficiency
3. Print line of data
4. Scan required passenger efficiency
